<p>Cuda For FOAM Link</p>

<p>cufflink is a library for linking numerical methods based on Nvidia's 
Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA™) C/C++ programming language
and OpenFOAM®.</p>

<a id="system-requirements" class="anchor" href="#system-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>System requirements</h1>

<p>cufflink was developed and tested on Linux Ubuntu 10.04 amd64 with CUDA 4.0, 
Thrust v1.4, and Cusp 0.2.0. To check your version of Thrust, Cusp, and cufflink, 
please compile the version.cu file and run in the command line to give the output</p>

<pre><code>Thrust     v1.4
Cusp       v0.2.0
Cufflink   v0.0.1
</code></pre>

<p>Check your version of nvcc with the command nvcc --version and the output should be similar to: </p>

<pre><code>nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2011 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Thu_May_12_11:09:45_PDT_2011
Cuda compilation tools, release 4.0, V0.2.1221
</code></pre>

<p>Also, ensure that your mpi installation is correct so that the runParallel test script can be run.<br>
To see whether your parallel version of openfoam is running, test the interFoam/damBreak tutorial</p>

<h1>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h1>

<p>Ensure a working OpenFOAM-1.6-ext version and that one can compile a simple 
OpenFOAM solver.  Ensure that CUDA 4.0, Thrust v1.4, and Cusp 0.2.0 
are installed and running examples.  A simple cusp example is provided in 
this directory as testcg.cu and is compiled with nvcc -o testcusp testcg.cu 
and run with the command ./testcusp  The output from this solver should be similar to:</p>

<pre><code>Solver will continue until residual norm 0.01 or reaching 100 iterations 
  Iteration Number  | Residual Norm
                0       1.000000e+01
                1       1.414214e+01
                2       1.093707e+01
                3       8.949321e+00
                4       6.190057e+00
                5       3.835191e+00
                6       1.745482e+00
                7       5.963550e-01
                8       2.371136e-01
                9       1.152524e-01
               10       3.134469e-02
               11       1.144416e-02
               12       1.824177e-03
Successfully converged after 12 iterations.
</code></pre>

<p>To compile the solvers to be used in OpenFOAM, use the script:  </p>

<pre><code>./nvccWmakeAll &lt;arch&gt; &gt; make.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>

<p>Where  is sm_10, sm_13, or sm_20 depending on your device architecture.  Many warnings are given dealing 
with white spaces and tuple.inl functions and can be ignored with this version of cufflink.</p>

<a id="multi-gpu-implementation-required" class="anchor" href="#multi-gpu-implementation-required" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Multi-GPU Implementation **<strong><em>REQUIRED</em></strong>**</h1>

<p>The multi-gpu implementation REQUIRES the file lduInterface.H in cufflink to replace the OpenFOAM core file 
located in:</p>

<pre><code>OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-1.6-ext/src/OpenFOAM/matrices/lduMatrix/lduAddressing/lduInterface 
</code></pre>

<p>This change requires a complete recompilation of openfoam.  Also, each time the multi-gpu solver is used the 
first iteration is usually the longest.  This is most likely caused by having the card in compute-mode 0 
which allows multiple parallel cpu threads to access the same gpu.  In order to reduce this overhead 
associated with cpu-gpu thread initialization, change the compute-mode to 1 by running:</p>

<pre><code>sudo /usr/bin/nvidia-smi -c 1 -g &lt;gpu to change&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>where the  is an integer labeling the device number.  To find the device number, use the 
deviceQuery program from the Nvidia SDK to see before and after your call of nvidia-smi.  To see supported 
devices that allow compute mode changes, simply call nvidia-smi without flags or arguements.  See the 
following thread on the cusp-users group for more information ( <a href="http://goo.gl/ojQc9">http://goo.gl/ojQc9</a> and also <a href="http://goo.gl/kc1YU">http://goo.gl/kc1YU</a> ).</p>

<a id="running-in-openfoam" class="anchor" href="#running-in-openfoam" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running in OpenFoam</h1>

<p>Once the cufflink library has been compiled, in order to use the code in openfoam one needs to include the line</p>

<pre><code>libs ("libCufflink.so");
</code></pre>

<p>in your controlDict file of the case you are running.  In addition, a solver must be chosen in the fvSolution 
file under solver key word similar to:</p>

<pre><code>solver cufflink_CG;
preconditioner  none;
tolerance        1e-10;
maxIter      10000;
storage         1; //COO=0 CSR=1 DIA=2 ELL=3 HYB=4 all other numbers use default CSR
gpusPerMachine  2; //for multi gpu version on a machine with 2 gpus per machine node
AinvType ;
dropTolerance ;
linStrategym ;
</code></pre>

<h1>
<a id="testing-the-installation" class="anchor" href="#testing-the-installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing the installation</h1>

<p>To ensure that your original test directory is not altered and/or accidentally uploaded to the svn server, 
make a copy of the cufflinkTest folder and place this in the $FOAM_RUN directory.</p>

<p>A group of test cases has been provided in order to ensure that the install is working.  They are located in 
the cufflinkTest/testCases directory and require that the cufflinkTest/testCufflinkFoam application be compiled.  Once you are ready,go the test/testCases folder and run the runSerialTests bash script to compare cufflink and OpenFOAM.<br>
Running the script getTimes will grep all the log files and extract time information (this script needs improvement).<br>
Clean the test cases with the Allclean script to remove data since a full test will take over 11 GB of hard drive space.
To test the parallel cases, use the runParallelTests script.  It is currently designed to run up to 6 processors and 
cufflinkTest/decomposeParDict file must be changed accordingly if you workstation has less than 6 processors</p>

<p>For additional information to be printed to the screen such as the storage method, normalization factor, etc. go 
to the openfoam file:</p>

<pre><code>    $FOAM_INST_DIR/etc/controlDict
</code></pre>

<p>and change lduMatrix to 2.  This will print additional information to the screen to aid in debugging.</p>
